This repository hosts the materials and code associated with the research project "Visualization-Enhanced Aggregated Search Interfaces", as presented at ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction And Retrieval [CHIIR 2024] ((https://chiir2024.github.io/allpapers.html) and published in the ACM Digital Library.

## Abstract

Search interfaces serve as the primary gateway to information retrieval (IR) platforms, with each IR platform possessing its unique interface. Yet, the challenge remains in delivering diverse content effectively to users, particularly when dealing with unfamiliar sources or content. Instead of platforms presenting search results from different sources in individual tabs for distinct sources, which can lead to user confusion and over-reliance on certain tabs, this paper investigates an approach to aggregate search results into a single, unified display, providing users with a consolidated list. Our research emphasizes novel presentation methodologies that combine insights from previous studies with advanced visualization techniques. The aim is to offer an intuitive and streamlined search experience for all users. Key research questions address: the design of interfaces to blend aggregated results while visually indicating their provenance; the advantages of such interfaces; the impact of search result diversity on perceived trustworthiness; and the applicability of the approach in structured data domains, specifically digital humanities archives and digital academic libraries.
Our structured, iterative research methodology encompasses a three-phased approach: starting with low-fidelity prototyping, moving to medium-fidelity design iteration, and currently working towards functional prototype development. An upcoming controlled laboratory study, complemented by data collection tools like LogUI and eye-tracking, aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of user interaction and attention patterns and evaluate the proposed designs, providing insights into their effectiveness and the implications of visual result provenance.
